This project is to demonstrate building REST API.

I have the logger function work as middleware, so that once a request, it will print to the log file automatically.

For Mongo, since I have problem with my computer, I used dummy data instead.

For the scripts in package.json, I wrote "npm start" and "npm run start:dev". The dev one uses nodemon so that it can watch for any
changes in the root directory.
